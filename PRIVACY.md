# Privacy Policy for Fallow

**Effective Date:** October 1, 2024

At Fallow, we believe your health data belongs solely to you.

## 1. Data Collection & Storage
Fallow operates on a **Local-First** principle.

- All data is stored locally on your device using `LocalStorage` and the native file system.

## 2. Third-Party Services
Fallow does not use any third-party analytics (like Google Analytics or Firebase) or advertising SDKs. You track your cycle in a completely private environment.
